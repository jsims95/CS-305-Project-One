# CS-305-Project-One
This is the first project for CS-305, Software Security for SNHU

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
  -Artemis Financial wants to modernize its operations. As a crucial part of the success of its custom software, the company also wants to use the latest and most effective software security. Artemis Financial has 
   a RESTful web application programming interface (API). The company is seeking Global Rain’s expertise about how to protect the organization from external threats.
  
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  -I covered the valies of security, external threats, and modernization requirements.
  
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  -Most parts of the vulnerability assessment was difficult to me, but the manual review proved helpful.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  -•	Input Validation:
o	Prevent injection attacks like SQL injection and XSS by validating and sanitizing all user inputs.
•	Secure Data Storage:
o	Store sensitive customer data securely using encryption (e.g., AES for stored data) to prevent unauthorized access.
•	Authentication and Authorization:
o	Implement strong password policies, two-factor authentication (2FA), and role-based access control to safeguard user accounts and restrict access.
•	API Security:
o	Secure API interactions to ensure that client-server communications are encrypted and free from vulnerabilities.
•	Error Handling and Logging:
o	Prevent information leakage by avoiding stack trace exposure or revealing sensitive application details in error messages.
•	Cryptography:
o	Use industry-standard cryptographic algorithms to secure sensitive data both in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.
•	Code Quality:
o	Adhere to secure coding practices to prevent buffer overflows, memory leaks, or other exploitable coding errors.
